# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the process of resume customization for different job applications.

The workflow:
1. Accepts a resume PDF and job description
2. Extracts resume text from PDF
3. Uses AI to tailor the resume
4. Generates ATS-friendly structured content
5. Converts the generated content into LaTeX format
6. Produces a professional resume output automatically

This project demonstrates:
- AI workflow automation
- LLM integration
- PDF processing
- Structured JSON handling
- Resume optimization
- API integration
- Workflow orchestration using n8n

# Example Workflow Execution

## Step 1 — Resume Upload

User uploads:
- Resume PDF
- Job Description

---

## Step 2 — PDF Extraction

The workflow extracts:
- Skills
- Experience
- Projects
- Education
- Certifications

from the uploaded resume.

---

## Step 3 — AI Resume Tailoring

Anthropic LLM:
- analyzes the job description
- optimizes resume keywords
- rewrites bullet points
- improves ATS compatibility

---

## Step 4 — JSON Formatting

The tailored resume is converted into:
- structured JSON
- clean formatting
- reusable data structure

---

## Step 5 — LaTeX Conversion

Structured JSON is converted into:
- professional LaTeX resume template
- ATS-friendly formatting
- clean resume layout

---

## Step 6 — PDF Generation

The final resume PDF is generated automatically through HTTP API integration.

---
